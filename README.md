# Fourier Drawing

This application is based in a YouTube video by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) that explained how to draw a shape with rotating vectors, based on the priciples of the Fourier Transformation.

# What's this application?

This application is a simple Python application, written in version [3.8.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-385/), using [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) as the GUI Toolkit.

This is supposed to be a funcional proof of concept. Feel free to use it as it.

# How to use the application

### Step #1: Activate the Python virtual environment

    source env/bin/activate
    
### Step #2: Run the application

    python src/app.py
    
### Step #3: Draw your shape

In this step you can draw the shape used as a basis.
To do that do a left mouse click to start drawing, move the mouse to create the shape and do a left mouse click to finish.
